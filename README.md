Question 1

There are three types of edits that can be performed on string: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit or zero edit away. 
 Example 
 pale, ple -> true
 pales, pale -> true
 pale, bale -> true
 pale, bake -> false 
 
Question 2
 
 Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
 
Question 3
 
How would  you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function which returns the minimum element? push, pop and min shouuld all operate in O(1) time. 

Question 4

Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes. 

Question 5

Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".
